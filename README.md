# Baselines Mobile Foundation

**Mobile foundation for teams that create mobile applications repeatedly.**

## Why Baselines exists

Most mobile teams don’t struggle with unique features. They struggle with **rebuilding the same foundation over and over** and struggling to keep it aligned with evolving best practices.

With every new app, teams waste cycles repeating:
* Architecture decisions & module boundaries
* CI/CD wiring and tooling setup
* Implementing feature initializers
* Analytics, logging, environment configuration
* And more

**Baselines** exists to turn that repetition into a **stable, reusable platform**, allowing you to focus on the code that actually makes your product unique.

## What you’ll find here

This organization hosts the ecosystem behind the Baselines architecture:

* **Core Foundations:** Opinionated foundation for Kotlin Multiplatform, Android, and iOS.
* **Infrastructure:** Tooling for analytics, config management, feature toggles, encryption, and more.
* **Playgrounds:** Reference implementations to demonstrate architectural patterns in isolation.

> **Note:** Some repositories here are open-source, while others represent commercial or private offerings. For a full breakdown of the stack, visit [baselines.io](https://baselines.io).

## Who is this for?

Baselines is designed for those who value **systems over manual effort**.

* **Studios:** You ship apps for clients and need to cut the "Day 0 to Day 14" setup time down to hours, ensuring every delivery meets a high standard of code quality.
* **Startups:** You are validating a mobile idea but need an architecture that allows you to scale immediately without requiring a total rewrite once you hit product-market fit.
* **Product Teams:** You manage a portfolio of internal apps and need a unified tooling/architecture across the board without context switching.
* **Individual Engineers:** You need a **production-grade, clean setup without opinionated feature overhead**. The Free Tier provides a professional foundation that gets out of your way, so you can just build.

If you have ever looked at a new project setup and thought, *"We’ve solved this before, why are we solving it again?"* - this foundation is for you.

## Philosophy

We follow a few simple principles:

1.  **Foundations should be built once, not repeatedly.**
2.  **Architecture should be enforced by code, not remembered by people.**
3.  **Tooling should accelerate development, not obstruct it.**
4.  **Value should compound:** Improvements to the baseline should benefit every app you manage.

## Getting started & Community

We value clear intent, architectural thinking, and practical feedback.

1.  **Explore:** Check the pinned repositories.
2.  **Discuss:** Use individual repo discussions for architecture questions, design trade-offs, and usage patterns.
3.  **Contribute:** Open issues or PRs if you find improvements in our open-source modules.
